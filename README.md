# ARGYLE CHALLENGE

Hello guys! Thanks for opportunity, i am very happy with the idea that we could work together soon!

Before you take the code, i have some considerations here:

1. Actually i am working a lot in new projects for Avenue Code/MZ GROUP, my actual job, including WEEKENDS with studies and new deadline challenges, so i take your challenge in the weekend, using every free second that i had focus on MUST TO HAVE actions to send you this on monday and i think we have a good code here! It was a good challenge, thank you! Improvements about working with captcha and other things will be done in the next version!

2. I started using the best practices of OOP and SOLID principles thinking about scalability, maintenability and clean code.

3. The tests are simple, but off course we can improve the tests in number and complexity.

## Local setup

1) Install docker if you dont have it

2) Run container with `docker-compose build` on terminal

3) Run application with `docker-compose up` on terminal

P.S: for technical purposes i left the .env file in the root of the project, you can change the values of the variables in there.
